## Overview
To address the overhead of managing configurations of various services, Sunbird provides the option of a central configuration service. The configuration services can be used to update configuration of any service on the anytime without requiring a service redeployment. 

Updating an instance on Sunbird involves the following tasks:

1. Code update that requires code change and re-building instance  
2. Environment variables update that requires redeploying instance 
3. Database update in the runtime
4. Configuration Services that updates the database and the code instantly through APIs 

The system updates in Sunbird is catered using services configuration services. The configuration services uses a centralized method and thereby reducing the overhead of managing multiple components. This document details the procedures on how to manage the configuration services on Sunbird. They can be used to update configuration of any service instantly without requiring a service redeployment.

This document details the procedures on how to manage the configuration services on Sunbird.

> **Note:** To effectively work with APIs, the administrator should be familiar with JSON structures and relevant tools to call APIs, like the Postman tool.

## Prerequisites

1. An intialized Sunbird instance with channel with hierarchial structure
2. API Key to access Sunbird APIs. To create an API key refer [How to generate a Sunbird API key](developer-docs/how-to-guide/generate_apikey/)
3. Software that can make API calls like curl or [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation)

## Chain Management for Configuration Services

Rules are defined to maintain the configuration services in a hierarchial structure to run properly.   

1. Instance: contains the configuration variables in a well defined format, for a particular instance of Sunbird and its associated tenants    
2. Tenant: contains the configuration variables in a well defined format, for the tenant and its organizations
3. Organization: contains the configuration variables in a well defined format for the organization

Each level of heirarchy has defined microservices that needs configuration and contains the variables in the key-value pair that are unique. These key-value pairs are grouped for ease of access in different components of the instance. Micro services needs configuration and the variables are the key-value pair that are unique values and needs to be grouped for ease of access. For example: the API_timeout is defined at all heirarchial level but contains different values for each level, in this case the configuration service has increased performance while changing the values of the variable. 

## Creating Configuration Services

The initial or the default configurations are defined in HOCON format and is available with the <*which*, need link> code. The configuration is available in [environment variables]() *external file hosted on cloud or a separate GIT repository*. During bootstrapping, the configuration service must read system configuration available through an environment variable and understand the source of rest of the configurations <need example>. It should read <what> from the specified location, parse and store with the attached storage.

## Updating Configuration Services

To add or update a configuration, a system admin updates the respective [HOCON file](*need link*) (base config file). These changes are periodically (can we specify time interval) picked up by a scheduled job which then triggers the utility or the module to read the configuration changes, parse it and store them in the  specified storage.

## Consuming Configuration Services

The configuration service connects with different services to retrieve (and update) configurations. These services include 

  - KV store service
  - Database
  - Environment variable
  - Properties file and so on
  
Depending on the consumer need it should be able to fetch the required configuration from the given service.

*(need a valid example)*

This configuration service should also support fallback among connected services. In case the required configuration is not available with a particular connected service, the client module should be able to query next in line service to retrieve the required configuration. The depth of fallback should not be limited to one so that the module may keep looking through all defined services for the particular configuration.
